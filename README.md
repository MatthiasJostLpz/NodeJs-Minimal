# NodeJs-Minimal

This repository is a minimalist template for setting up a Node.js project. It provides a clean and efficient starting point for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications with Node.js. Ideal for developers looking to quickly bootstrap a new project without unnecessary bloat.

## Features

- **Minimal Setup**: A barebones project structure to get you started with Node.js development.
- **Basic Configuration**: Essential configuration files for a Node.js project, including `package.json` and `.gitignore`.
- **Express.js Integration**: Basic setup for an Express.js server, ready for extension.
- **REST API Skeleton**: A simple REST API example to demonstrate the basics of route handling.
- **Middleware Setup**: Basic middleware included for handling common tasks like logging and JSON parsing.
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration for environment variables using dotenv.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling mechanisms in place for smoother development.
- **Nodemon Integration**: For automatic server restarts during development.
- **Folder Structure**: Organized folder structure to keep code modular and maintainable.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Focused on minimalism to ensure fast performance and easy scalability.

## Getting Started

### Initialize the Project

Create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js project:

```sh
mkdir NodeJs-Minimal
cd NodeJs-Minimal
npm init -y
```

### Install Dependencies

Install Express and Nodemon (for development):

```sh
npm install express
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

### Clone the Repository

If you want to clone this template repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NodeJs-Minimal.git
cd NodeJs-Minimal
```

### Install Project Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Run the Server

To start the server:

```sh
npm start
```

Or with Nodemon for development:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define your environment variables as needed.

Example `.env`:

```txt
PORT=3000
```

## Usage

Running the Project

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Your minimal Node.js project is now set up with one model, one controller, and one route. When you start the server and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/samples`, you should see the sample data returned as JSON.

## Ideal For

- Developers looking to quickly bootstrap a new Node.js project with a minimal setup.
- Projects where a clean, organized, and maintainable codebase is crucial.
- Learning purposes, to understand the essentials of setting up a Node.js project.
