# Middleware in Node.js

Middleware functions are essential components in web applications built with Node.js, especially when using libraries like `connect` and `express`. Middleware can handle requests, modify request and response objects, and manage the application's control flow.

## What is Middleware?

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware can perform various tasks, including:

- Logging requests
- Parsing request bodies
- Managing sessions
- Serving static files
- Handling errors

## Using Middleware in `express`

Middleware in `express` is added using the `.use()` method. Each middleware function can end the request-response cycle by sending a response, or pass control to the next middleware function using `next()`.

### Example Setup with Middleware

```js
import express from 'express';
import compression from 'compression';
import morgan from 'morgan';

const app = express();

// Log all incoming requests
app.use(morgan('common'));

// Serve static files from the "public" directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Compress all responses
app.use(compression());
```

In this example, three middleware functions are used:

- `morgan`: Logs all incoming requests.
- `express.static`: Serves static files from the public directory.
- `compression`: Compresses all responses.

## Common Middleware Examples

### 1. express.json() and express.urlencoded()

These middleware functions parse incoming request bodies and make the parsed data available under `req.body`.

```js
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

### 2. cookie-parser

Parses cookies attached to the client request object and makes them available under `req.cookies`.

```js
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';

app.use(cookieParser());
```

### 3. compression

Compresses response bodies for all requests that traverse through the middleware.

```js
app.use(compression());
```

### 4. express.static

Serves static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from a specified directory.

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

### 5. express-session

Stores session data on the server side and makes it available under `req.session`.

```js
import session from 'express-session';

app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true
}));
```

### 6. express-openid-connect or passport

These middleware functions handle user authentication.

```js
import { auth } from 'express-openid-connect';
import passport from 'passport';

// Example using express-openid-connect
app.use(auth({
  issuerBaseURL: 'https://YOUR_DOMAIN',
  clientID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  secret: 'a long, randomly-generated string stored in env'
}));

// Example using passport
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());
```

### 7. morgan

Logs request details to the console.

```js
import morgan from 'morgan';

app.use(morgan('common'));
```
